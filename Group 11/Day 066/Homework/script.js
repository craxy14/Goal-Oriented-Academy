//   console.log(userInput);
// }if(userInput <= 1){
//   console.log("Time's Up!");
// }

// Prime Number Printer:
// Create an array.
// Start with the number 1.
// Using a while loop, iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
// Check if the current number is Prime.
// If it is, add number to array.
// Continue to the next number and repeat until 50.
// Console.log array.


// Object Information Display:
// Create a program that displays basic information about a predefined object.
// Define an object representing a person with properties like name, age, and occupation.
// Display the information stored in the object to the user.

// function Person(name, age, country) {
//   this.name = name;
//   this.age = age;
//   this.country = country;
// }

// let user = new Person("mate", 20, "Georgia");

// console.log(user);


// Calculate Factorial:
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer.
// Use a for loop to calculate and display the factorial of that number.

// let factorial = 1
// let userNumber = prompt("Enter number for factorial of it")
// while(userNumber > 1){
//   factorial *= userNumber
//   userNumber--
//   console.log(factorial);
// }

// Array Summation:
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers, separated by spaces.
// Split the input string into an array of numbers.
// Use an array method to calculate and display the sum of all the numbers in the array.
